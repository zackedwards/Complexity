# Complexity & Travis-CI Lab

[![build status of master](https://travis-ci.org/zackedwards/Complexity.svg?branch=dependabot/npm_and_yarn/lodash-4.17.19)](https://travis-ci.org/zackedwards/Complexity)

In this lab, you'll be implementing simple algorithms for checking basic properties of code complexity, and working with Travis-CI for Continuous Integration.

Two design patterns are of importance here:
* A [Builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern), which is used to build up state and then finally emit.
* A [Visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern), which is used to abstract the process of visiting a data structure such as abstract syntax tree (AST). The only input you have to provide is what action to perform at each node.

### Esprima

Writing programs to do static code analysis on Javascript is easier now than ever, thanks to [esprima](http://esprima.org/) - the Javascript parser library. We will practice how to use esprima to do something fairly simple â€“ measure basic code complexity metrics of JavaScript programs. 

##### Video
This video provides more background about esprima:
Watch [5:00-14:30,28:00-34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACYZFkvq0Sk).

##### Interactive Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
Use the [demo page](http://esprima.org/demo/parse.html) to see what a code snippet looks like, in order to help you navigate the data structure. Better to open in a separate browser tab, as you will need to work with it for coding inspiration.

For example, the following snippet:

```
function functionName( node )
{
	if( node.id )
	{
		return node.id.name;
	}
	return "anon function @" + node.loc.start.line;
}
```

Will appear as following, and:

### Lab activities:

The repository contains a stub that parses a javascript file and visits each function. 

1. Run the program and print all the tokens in an ast.
   ```
      npm install
      node analysis.js
   ```

2. Do a simple calculation (2 Points Each) 

   a) **ParameterCount**: The number of parameters for functions (FunctionBuilder)
   b) **String Usage**: How many string literals are used in file? (FileBuilder)

3. Using multiple visitors (2 Points Each) 

   a) **SimpleCyclomaticComplexity**: The number of if statements/loops + 1.
   b) **MaxConditions**: The max number of condition predicates (expressions seperated by `||`, `&&`) in an if statement.

4. Check build status on Travis-CI when committing each new function. Submit a screenshot of the final build. (2 Points) 

5. Advanced (2 Extra Points)  

   a) **MaxNestingDepth**: The max depth of scopes (nested ifs, loops, etc) -- this one is hard, only expect a few to get to do finish this one (using parents/etc).
